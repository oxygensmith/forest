# Forest

You're an elf. Sneak between trees, don't get captured by the orcs. Manipulate orcs with your movements so they clobber themselves on trees; when they're all gone, you win. Don't run into trees, rivers, the mountains, or the border yourself. Orcs have a very robotic comparison-to-the-player's-x-and-y logic for 'pursuit.' Runs in the browser. 

This game was made to show my kid how games on the iPad, browser etc. are *developed* over time. I let him make decisions about how the game works. Some minor things I don't agree with (why is the border red?) but he has some good ideas in the list to be added. He decided to add rivers and mountains and make the board bigger.

**Forest** is based on my memory of someone's turn-based survival game project, played on the Veronica VAX Mainframe project at Okanagan College, 1979. (Would love to get more information about the original game). I've made minor enhancements (color, etc.)
