# Forest

You're an elf. Sneak between trees, don't get captured by the orcs. Manipulate orcs with your movements so they clobber themselves on trees; when they're all gone, you win. Don't run into trees, rivers, the mountains, or the border yourself. Orcs have a very robotic comparison-to-the-player's-x-and-y logic for 'pursuit.' Runs in the browser. 

I am developing this game with my 7-year-old as a way of learning about how games are *developed* over time. He makes decisions about how the game works, like adding a river and mountains.

See https://forest.robbutz.com for the latest version of the game.

**Forest** is based on my memory of someone's turn-based survival game project, played on the Veronica VAX Mainframe project at Okanagan College, 1979. (Would love to get more information about the original game). I've made minor enhancements (color, etc.)
